= Komi Interview: Technical Test

Candidates can use any environment (IDE/console) they feel comfortable with.

It is important to note that the tester is more interested in your thinking and approach than "getting it right".
So with this in mind, explain your reasoning and ask questions as you progress through your solution.
Each challenge has a corresponding unit test in the same folder.
